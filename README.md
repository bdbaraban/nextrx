## Description :speech_balloon:

NextRX is my latest significant personal project. I began this project wanting to learn NoSQL databases - specifically, MongoDB - and React server-side-rendering - specifically, Next.js. Projects are always more fun when they are personally relevant; hence, I combined these interests with my CrossFit hobby, and NextRX was born!

### Where did the name NextRX come from?

Within the CrossFit community, RX is short for "prescribed" - ie. if you complete a workout according to the programmed weights, you are considered as having completed that workout "prescribed," or "RX".

I intend NextRX to be inspiring. With this attractive, intuitive application, you can track your workout progress and visualize your growth in strength over time, always purusing that next "RX".

...or, really, the application is built on Next.js, and NextRX instantly came to mind as a cool name.
